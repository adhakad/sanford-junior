                                    <p>At SANFORD classrooms are a cozy, comfy, cuddly place where Children are
                                        constructively engaged and teachers are observing, facilitating, and motivating
                                        them. Our classrooms are thoughtfully designed and structured, keeping in mind
                                        the safety and wellbeing of children. We believe that small group activities can
                                        happen naturally in the classrooms hence, we keep 1:15 teacher to student ratio
                                        in our schools.</p>
